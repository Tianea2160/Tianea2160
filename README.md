## Key Projects at Techtaka

### üì¶ Logistics Picking Work Lifecycle Improvement
- **Problem**: Order cancellations required product restocking, causing resource waste
- **Solution**: Implemented delayed work creation based on remaining work counts and improved process flow
- **Impact**:
  - Secured ~2 hours 10 minutes of order cancellation time without restocking per order
  - Despite 35% increase in order cancellations, achieved 7.8% decrease in restocking requirements
  - Designed business architecture using Choreography-based Saga pattern for inventory location recommendations

### üöö Single Product Movement Optimization System
- **Problem**: Inefficient sorting without limits on product types per container
- **Solution**: Experimented with expanding maximum product types from 1 to 3, then 5 per container
- **Impact**:
  - Reduced average processing time per order by 42.86% (70 seconds to 40 seconds)
  - Decreased collection tasks by 78.9% (2,388 to 505)
  - Achieved daily workforce reduction of approximately 1.33 workers

### üîí Distributed Lock Annotation-Based Duplication Prevention
- **Problem**: Occasional duplicate work completion events causing inventory double-counting
- **Solution**: Implemented Redis-based distributed lock with custom annotation (@DistributedLock)
- **Impact**:
  - Completely eliminated duplicate processing issues
  - Currently used in more than 4 domains across the system
  - Enhanced developer productivity by simplifying lock implementation

### ‚ö° Shipping Instruction Processing System Optimization
- **Problem**: Processing 300 orders took 10-15 minutes, exceeding client timeout (1 minute)
- **Solution**: Transformed synchronous API calls to asynchronous Kafka-based processing
- **Impact**:
  - Reduced API response time from ~12 minutes to ~1 second (99.86% decrease)
  - Decreased actual data processing time from 10-12 minutes to ~3 seconds (up to 97.5% reduction)
  - Eliminated POD CPU overload issues (previously reaching 100%)

### üìÖ Same-Day Receipt Processing Capacity Management
- **Problem**: Lack of volume management system for same-day receipts, risking SLA violations
- **Solution**: Led the development of a processing type capacity management system
- **Impact**:
  - Prevented center overload by blocking excess orders during 31% of operating days
  - Satisfied Naver direct contract SLA and improved customer satisfaction
  - Enabled data-driven resource allocation through receipt calendar functionality
